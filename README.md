# Speakers

Speak at Serverless London User Group! Create an issue with details of your proposed talk and we'll review it in the open!

You can track the progress of the talk approval here. https://github.com/serverless-london/speakers/projects/1

We've borrowed this format of submissions from the [LNUG team](https://github.com/lnug/speakers)

## Talks

- We're pretty open on format. We're happy to accomodate talks from 10 minutes to 40 minutes. We'll curate the meetup around the talks we have.
- We're a Serverless meetup, so anything serverless related is welcomed.
- For now we're still doing virtual talks only, which we prefer to be done live. We do expect to resume in person events later this year (2021), but will look at retaining some online sessions.
- By submitting a talk you're giving us permission to upload the talk and broadcast it live.
- We prefer talks about real world experience. 
- If you're from a vendor that wants to show off the latest Serverless world changing product, please no death by powerpoint, and avoid pitching.

## First Time Speakers

If you're new to public speaking, we're happy to provide coaching and advice. Just mention it, and we'll reach out to help. We actively encourage new speakers.

## Code of Conduct

We have a code of conduct in place that applies to all speakers, sponsors, organisors and attendees, whether an in person or online event.
